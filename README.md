   ```

2. Open Microsoft Edge and go to the Extensions settings:

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any LinkedIn job listing page (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/*`).
   
2. On the job details page, you will see two new buttons:
   - **Copy Job Details**: This button will copy the company name, job title, location, and job URL to your clipboard in a tab-separated format.
   - **Copy URL**: This button will copy just the job URL to your clipboard.

3. After clicking either button, the information will be copied to your clipboard and ready to paste anywhere.

## Example

On a LinkedIn job page, after clicking **Copy Job Details**, your clipboard will contain something like this:

```
Microsoft    Senior Software Engineer    Redmond, WA    https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/123456789
